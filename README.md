# ColorFinderX
ColorFinderX is a Python program that lets you search and identify colors with just a double-click on a given image.

I am using pycharm community edition 2023.1.3

After opening this project in pycharm open color_detection.py, then edit the run config, in which set the parameter to "-i girl.jpg".

A window will open with a image, double click anywhere on the image to know the name of color with it's RGB value!

Thank you!
